## Reproducible research

> * Have you heard about it?
> * Maybe you've heard about the [Cousera Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata) course
> * How would you define it?
> * Is it the same as replicability?
> * Is it important?

    Science moves forward then discoveries are replicated
    and reproduced

[_Implementing Reproducible Research_](https://osf.io/s9tya/wiki/home/)

## Replication

    Replication, the practice of independently implementing
    scientific experiments to validate specific findings,
     is the cornerstone of discovering scientific truth.

[_Implementing Reproducible Research_](https://osf.io/s9tya/wiki/home/)

## Reproducibility

    Reproducibility can be thought of as a different
    standard of validity from replication because it
    forgoes independent data collection and uses the
    methods and data collected by the original investigator.

[_Implementing Reproducible Research_](https://osf.io/s9tya/wiki/home/)

## A bit more practical

    The sharing of analytic data and computer codes
    uses to map those data into computational results
    is central to any comprehensive definition of
    reproducibility.

## Why its important?

    Except for the simplest of analyses, the computer
    code used to analyze a dataset is the only record
    that permits others to fully understand what a
    researcher has done.

## Scrapping example

> * Open [Scrapping Ravens data from ESPN](http://rpubs.com/lcollado/4080)
> * Is this document reproducible?
> * What information is missing?
> * How could we improve it?
> * What about [rMaps Mexico map](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/02/26/excited-by-willingness-to-help-get-things-done/#.VYL992RVhHw)?

## R session information {.smaller}

```{r 'sessionInfo'}
sessionInfo()
```

## {.smaller}

```{r 'session_info'}
library('devtools'); session_info()
```

## Reproducible documents

> * Have you ever had your code in one file, your description of the results in another file?
> * Ever made copy-paste mistakes?
> * What if you were asked to change some models or revise the document?
> * Was it easy to maintain?

> * What would be a reproducible document for you?

## Reproducible docs in R

> * [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is the easiest
> * It's based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics): simple human readable syntax that generates HTML docs
> * Also uses [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to create files in many formats
> * You maintain a __single__ file! It has the code, figures and description of results. It then creates a file in the format you want to share with others.

## Examples

> * [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) (can buy for $0.00)
> * [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), for example [Data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html)
> * [Polyester: simulating RNA-seq datasets with differential transcript expression](https://github.com/leekgroup/polyester_code/blob/master/polyester_manuscript.Rmd) paper which creates [this html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alyssafrazee/polyester_code/blob/master/polyester_manuscript.html).
> * [Timing information report](https://github.com/leekgroup/derSoftware/blob/gh-pages/timing/timing.Rmd) which renders into [this html](http://lcolladotor.github.io/derSoftware/timing/timing.html). Note that it has an interactive table.
